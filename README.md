🎯 The Mission: Beyond the Textbook

Traditional astronomy education can be static and abstract. We wanted to create a tool that sparks curiosity and makes complex concepts intuitive and unforgettable. Our goal was to build more than a simulation—we built a cosmic playground.

🌟 Standout Feature: Cinematic Eclipse Mode! 🌓

Our proudest innovation is the Cinematic Eclipse Explainer. We've transformed one of the most breathtaking celestial events into an interactive story.

Cinematic Camera: Witness solar and lunar eclipses from breathtaking, pre-set camera angles that highlight the cosmic alignment.

Kid-Friendly Explanations: Simple, clear, and engaging text pops up to explain what's happening, making it perfect for young, curious minds.

On-Demand Events: Don't wait for the next real-world eclipse! Trigger these stunning events with the click of a button.

This feature turns a complex astronomical event into a memorable, easy-to-understand spectacle.

✨ Core Features

🪐 Accurate Orbits & Rotations: Watch planets orbit the Sun and rotate on their axes at relatively scaled speeds.

🌌 High-Fidelity Models: Explore beautifully rendered 3D models of the Sun and planets using high-resolution textures from NASA.

🖱️ Intuitive Controls: Effortlessly Zoom, Pan, and Rotate the camera to explore the solar system from any angle.

📱 Fully Responsive: A seamless experience on any device, from a large desktop monitor to your smartphone on the go.

⚡ Blazing Fast with Vite: Leveraging Vite's next-generation frontend tooling for instant server start and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

🛠️ Tech Stack & Rationale

We chose our tools carefully to deliver the best performance and development experience.

</p>

Three.js: The cornerstone for our 3D rendering. Its power and flexibility allowed us to create a visually stunning and performant simulation directly in the browser.

Vite: For a hackathon, speed is everything. Vite's rapid development server and optimized build process enabled us to iterate and prototype features at an incredible pace.

JavaScript (ES6+): Kept our codebase modern, clean, and efficient.

🔮 Future Roadmap

This is just the beginning! We have a universe of ideas to explore:

[ ] Asteroid Belts & Dwarf Planets: Adding the Kuiper Belt, Asteroid Belt, and celestial bodies like Pluto and Ceres.

[ ] Real-time Data Integration: Fetching live data to show positions of famous comets and satellites.

[ ] VR/AR Mode: Creating a truly immersive experience with support for virtual and augmented reality headsets.

[ ] Interactive Planet Info Cards: Click on a planet to pull up fascinating facts and figures.
